Hello there! Here is an important article. Brief, but important. It defines a lot of concepts that are used inside Scifir for the projects related to the space, so learn them! They are very useful.

## New concepts

First, the outer space, which is used to define other concepts, is defined for clarity here:

- **Outer space:** The exterior space, only the "black" zone, being inside other planets doesn't corresponds the outer space.

The new concepts are the following:

- **Spacist:** Person that travels and lives through the outer space and planets.
- **Astroway:** Route defined inside the outer space to travel between astronomical objects, which can be planets, moons, stars, etc. The astroway is not necessarily marked in any way, in can be just drawn inside maps, because it's absurdly big to be constructed and marked inside the outer space.
- **Astrobuilding:** Building placed in the outer space.
- **Astroconstruction:** Construction placed in the outer space. It's different from an astrobuilding because an astrocontruction is not a building, but instead any other object, big or small, and even very big, placed in the outer space. For example, a sign that indicates the start of an astroway is an astroconstruction, but is not an astrobuilding.

## Types of spaceships

The types of spaceships, based on the distance they can travel, are the following three:

- **Planetary spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other planets of the same solar system it's placed in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Stellar spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other stars of the same galaxy in a human feasible amount of time. Also called **interstellar spaceship**.
- **Galactic spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other galaxies in a human feasible amount of time.

### Types of propulsors

The propulsors are named as the spaceship they allow to build:

- **Planetary propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other planets of the same solar system in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Stellar propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other stars of the same galaxy in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Galactic propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other planets of the same solar system in a human feasible amount of time.

## Specialized spaceships

The specialized spaceships for some specific purpose are the following:

- **Exploration spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in exploring the space.
- **Home spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in exploring the space, and also in being used as a home when exploring another planet. Then, it's not needed to construct a home in the planet being explored.
- **Construction spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in constructing in the outer space.
- **Repair spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in repairing other spaceships in the outer space.
- **Colonizer spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in creating a colony in a new planet.
- **Cargo spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in transporting high amounts of some minerals or substances.
