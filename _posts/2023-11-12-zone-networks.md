## Advantages of zone networks

**Zone networks** allow to search websites inside the network (which are registered as inside it), and to search people, chats, services, and any other entity, registered as inside the network.

## Types of zone networks

- **City network:** A network of all the city.
- **Region network:** A network of all the region.
- **Country network:** A network of a country.
- **Continent network:** A network of a continent.
- **Town network:** A network of a town.
- **Urban network:** A network of an urban zone.
- **Rural network:** A network of a rural zone.
- **Language network:** A network of a language.

The distinction of city and town corresponds to each country, and varies with countries. Then, by language, it varies too. A city can be defined with more or less surface, or by more or less amount of people.
