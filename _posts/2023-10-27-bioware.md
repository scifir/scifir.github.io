// TODO: Word for biowares in replacement of artificial to give names to different bioware devices, for example, to replace "Artificial heart" for some different word.

- **Bioware:** Multidisciplinary area focused on developing devices that can mimic or enhance parts of the body. Only devices that mimic really good real body parts and/or enhance greatly a function of a body part are considered bioware.

A bioware can be composed only of technological parts or be a mixture of technological and biological parts.

- **Internal bioware:** The bioware is placed inside the body, it's not seen from outside. Example: Artificial heart.
- **External bioware:** The bioware is placed outside the body, it's like an extension of the body, and can be seen from outside. Example: Artificial wings.

A bioware can have one or more characteristics, of one or more of the following categories of characteristics:

- **Physiology:** A bioware that replaces partial or totally a physiological behavior. They are called **physiological bioware**. They can be called also **medical biowares** inside a medical context.
- **Protection:** A bioware that provides protection against external menaces, which can be part of nature and/or life forms. They are called **protection bioware**.
- **Offensive:** A bioware that enhances offensive capacities of the organism. They are called **offensive bioware**. The intentions of this article are not to increase weapons, but they are a kind of bioware and so they are also classified here.
- **Senses:** A bioware that provides or enhances senses. They are called **sense bioware**.

## How to create bioware

### Essential concepts

- **Biomaterial:** Material that can interact with biological systems without damaging it.
- **Industrial design:** Design of an industrial device. For bioware, it's used to create them.
- **Cell:** Central unit of the body that controls how it behaves and lives. A bioware can be composed only of biomaterials or of biomaterials and cells.
- **Nanoelectromechanical system:** Electromechanical system of nanoscale size.

## Artificial organs

- **Artificial heart:**
- **Artificial lungs:**
- **Artificial kidneys:**
- **Artificial intestine:**
- **Artificial stomach:**
- **Artificial liver:**

## Artificial eye

An **artificial eye** can be created by joining biomaterials and cells together.
