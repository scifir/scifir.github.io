## About the acidity

The **acidity** is very dangerous, it can even kill, or, at least, seriously damage the body. The acidity also damages a high amount of different materials, it can destroy the floor, and, when droped from a second floor, it will destroy the floor and make a hole in it. It'll then continue destroying the floor of the first floor.

The **materials immune to acids** are the thermoplastics. Thermoplastics aren't affected by acids, and can be used as the material for containers of acids, because they don't get destroyed by them.
