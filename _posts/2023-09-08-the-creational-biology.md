Hello! I'm [Ismael Correa Castro](https://iarfen.github.io), and in this article I'll explain the basics concepts that I've defined for the field that I've called **creational biology**, also called **homunculogy**. Creational biology is defined as the **branch of biology** that deals with the creation of life with artificial means. A life form created by any artificial mean is called an **homunculous**.

## Theory of recurrent insertion

The **theory of recurrent insertion**, created by [Ismael Correa Castro](https://iarfen.github.io) on 2007, says the following:

"Every lifeform that can be drawn has a DNA sequence in the real world that makes it to exist".

The explanation of the theory of recurrent insertion is the following. The first important topic to explain is that a normal drawing of a life form is related to his aspect in real life, and no to his internal organs. Then, what the DNA needs to have as characteristic in order to be able to create a life form of any aspect is to be able to change the length, surface or volume as needed, to change the color of one part or another of the body as needed, and to add/remove hair, scales, and any other accessory part of the body.

Also, it's possible to change internal organs, and internal behaviour of the organism, but that's a very different topic. It's not clearly possible, yet, that a gene can do anything, and have any kind of effect inside the body. Then, although it's possible to create a life form of any shape, it's not clearly possible that a gene can do anything. Possibly there are a lot of options for genes internally, but possible no all options are available, or not available with the current aminoacids. By adding new aminoacids to a lifeform, which is possible to do, maybe that can change in the future, and then the genes can allow even more options, but that's needed to wait to be seen.

### Sizes

A life form of the same species of the basal DNA we are using to start developing that life form has, as differences, in his drawing and/or biological design, different volumes and surfaces, and different lengths. To change the length, surface or volume of a part of the body it's needed to change the level of expression of the set of genes responsible for it (which can be one or more gene, depending on which part it's).

To change the size of a life form it's needed to **change the level of expression** of the signaling molecules that stimulates the growing of that part of the body. Reading **embriology**, also called **developmental biology**, the information of which signaling molecule stimulates the growing of which part of the body, appears. If it's needed a level of expression that's not present in the transcription factors available, it's needed then to add a new transcription factor to the DNA, which has to cover that level of expression. Inside a laboratory of molecular biology, it's possible to test different transcription factors and to measure the level of expression each transcription factor achieves.

### Colors

To change **colors** it's needed first to have available a complete set of pigments for the body, each pigment being a different color. Looking at animals like the rainbow fishes, it's evident that all the palet of colors is available, with a high degree of density for each color tone. That's, a very high amount of the infinite conceivable colors is available to be used on life form in the form of molecular pigment.

A pigment is synthesized inside cells with several enzymes, each of them creates a part of the final pigment. Then, to change a pigment to another inside the DNA, it's needed to change one or more genes that codify the enzimes that synthesize that pigment, but not necessarilly all of the genes of the enzymes involved, just some of them.

### Accessory parts

To change **accessory parts** it's needed to change the cell type of them. The cell type for hair is, for example, the folicular cells. Scales, and any other accessory part of any kind, also have a specific cell type.

## The DNA editor

The **DNA editor**, also called **genetic editor**, is a program that allows to edit DNA sequences, to add new genes, modify existing genes, and even remove genes if that's what is needed to do. This program is like a code editor, but instead of listing files in their left panel, it lists the chromosomes with its respective genes (the genes appear nested in their respective chromosome). When opening each gene, a tab of that gene is opened. There, a description of the gene appears, which is read from a genetic database (there're genetic databases available online), and also it appears the structure of the codified protein, among other useful information.

## The incubation system

The **incubation system** is the system through which new homunculuous are made. It consists of three essential parts:

- **DNA editor:** The DNA of the life form is created using this software.
- **DNA synthetizer:** The DNA edited with the DNA editor is synthesized in real life by this device.
- **Incubator:** The incubator is like an artifical utherus that provides nutrients to the developing embryo.

## The DNA compilation

The **DNA compilation** is a software that compiles **LML files** into **DNA files**. Is like compilation of programming code, but applied to DNA. LML is the acronym of **L**ife **M**arkup **L**anguage, and LML files are then files that describe how a life form is genetically, which means that it describes its shape, the behaviour of its cells, and even its mental characteristics. The mental characteristics can be described only if the investigation and knowledge of genetics is advanced enough in the civilization in order to be available research abou how to change mental characteristics of life forms related to his genes.

## Types of homunculous

- **New animals:** Any animal species new, like a dragon, a pokemon, etc.
- **Clones:** Any clone of a real life form should be considered an homunculous.
- **Imaginary friends:** Any imaginary friend created in real life, having been thinked or based on an object, usually a plushie.

### Robots aren't homunculous

**Robots aren't alive**, they just apparent it, an partially. So, a robot is never an homunculuous, because it is not alive.

## Classification of homunculous

- **Biorobot:** An homunculous and, then, a biological organism, that has external appearance of a robot, but lives with organs.
- **Spirit:** An homunculous that has appearance of an spirit, besides if his body collides with the physical world or not.
- **Humanoid:** An homunculous with an appearance similar, but not identical, to the human species, like fairies, dwarfs, elves.

## Biological design

The **biological design** is how is called, inside homunculogy, as an schema, drawing, cell description, physiologic description and general description of how a life form has been thinked. It's how, inside creational biology, a life form is described, in all his characteristics, without excluding any important detail, in order to be created given those characteristics. A biological design has to be precise as possible, and usually it doesn't needs an enormous amount of explanation, it usually needs one or some pages to be detailed and complete.

## Genome and mental characteristics

## Genome and genre

## Destiny

## The free will related to gods

## Laws of homunculous

- An homunculous is **free** related to his creation.
- An homunculous has **free will**, it must obey the laws, the human rights and the homunculous rights.
- There's a **declaration of homunculous rights** equivalent to human rights.
- An homunculous can't be **strongly predestined**, he can only be predestined in small compromises.

## History of homunculogy

It was **2007**, me, Ismael Correa, I've been programming all the previous year, 2006, intensely, without a lot of pauses. The day I've started homunculogy has been when I've arrived to the theory of recurrent insertion. That day has been in 2007, as I remember in february (it, for sure, was during the summer, here at **Chile**). I was in my bed, I was thinking about sciencie-fiction, about science topics, and I was already a good enough programmer in order to know how to build an entire robot. In fact, I was having in big part the universal robots framework already designed, which was allowing to build any kind of robot. Then, I've thinked if it was possible to create new life forms, and what was required for that. The first thought that I've had was that it was just needed to change one correct nitrogenous base by another base, or even by a new nitrogenous base different than the existing ones, in order to change a little the life form. The idea was not that every change was little, some changes, as it was already known that year, are dangerous, or even lethal, but instead the idea was that some correct nitrogenous base, changed by another, was producing a little change. Then, it was possible too to add some nitrogenous bases as needed, or even to remove some nitrogenous bases, as needed, in order to produce the change needed, and not any other change. That's how the **theory of recurrent insertion** was born. In the following days, I've created the **DNA editor**, a scientific tool that allows to apply the theory of recurrent insertion to create new life forms by using as a starting point a DNA of a real life form, editing it, and arriving finally to the new life form. Together with the DNA editor, the idea of the **DNA compilation** has appeared, with **LML** ready in all his central sintaxis and features. During those same days, at the same time, I've develop all the theory behind the **life incubator** and a good amount of the theory behind the **DNA synthesizer**. The DNA synthesizer hasn't been theoretically ready those days, it has had to wait in part because it was needed more advances in the field of nanotechnology, which is essential to build a DNA synthesizer. Then, I've created too a **file format of nanoimpression**, which was covering all cases of shapes of matter.
