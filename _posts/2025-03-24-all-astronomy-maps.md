Hello here! This article is about the space maps, which are useful to create a book of all the maps known about a galaxy, because it orders them in a very easy way.

- **Universe map:** Map of all the universe, it indicates the galaxies. It's divided in different parts because all the galaxies doesn't fit in one single map. Instead, the map of all the universe is done dividing the universe in different very big parts and writing in a map all the galaxies of that part, and continuing then to the next part. Also, the parts that are at the top or at the bottom to the part drawn are also other parts to draw. Joining all those maps it's created the map of the universe.
- **Galaxy map:** Map of a galaxy. It can be divided in various submaps, not including also the maps of each solar system present inside the galaxy, and of each planet and moon of each of those solar systems.
- **Solar system map:** Map of a solar system. It must include the star and all the planets that orbit around it, with their moons, if they have. Other astronomical objects not as big as the planets and moons are optional to be drawn.
- **Planet map:** Map of a planet.
- **Moon map:** Map of a moon.

## Universe map

This map is constructed from different parts.

## Galaxy map

A **galaxy map** illustrates all the galaxy, with the different stars that it has. The galaxies usually have a form of a spiral, and then it appears, in the map, an spiral of stars. The most important is that the stars that include habited planets appear featured in order to know which stars are the ones most being profited by life forms.

## Solar system map

A **solar system map** is the map of the star and all the planets that orbit it, including its moons. An example of it is the classical solar system map that already exists for our solar system.

## Planet map

A **planet map** is the map of an entire planet. Instead of including all the details of all the countries, it includes the general parts of the planet, which are the continents, the oceans, and all geographic singularities it has. Optionally it can say the countries.

## Moon map

A **moon map** is like a planet map but of a moon. It must say the planet of the moon.

## Digital space maps

A **digital space map** includes more features, it allows to click on an astronomical object in order to open the map of it.
