# Website of Scifir

This is the website of [Scifir](https://www.github.com/scifir). It has been programmed under **Jekyll**, and it's hosted with **GitHub Pages**.

All the contents here, including articles, news, guides, and any other, are all, if they aren't visible in the website, in **draft status**, which means that aren't ready and, then, not officially published. When in draft status, they'll be available in some time more on the website.
