## Web design

- Buttons should have a normal state and a hover state with different aspect.
- All text links have to decorate with underline when hover, and don't have underline when not in hover state.

## HTML

- All links shouldn't have, apart from \<img\> tags, any other tag. They can't be child elements of tags different tan \<div\> (reasoning from inside \<body\>).
