A **genetic spirit** is an spirit that borns genetically from a life form when that life form dies. In order to be able to exist an spirit like that, first it's needed to have matter adequate for an spirit. Such matter can exist without a big amount of speculation. The way it can exist is the following: it's just needed matter similar to normal matter but that's traversable, for that purpose it's needed matter without mass. Matter without mass is traversable matter. This matter can too emit photons and then be visible, but it's traversable.

## Quantum particles as nutrients

 A **quantum particle** can be a nutrient inside the body, as minerals and vitamins, with the proper variants of proteins that handle them.
