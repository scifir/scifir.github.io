<h1>Standards of Scifir</h1>
<h2>Names of genes</h2>
<p>Here is explained the <strong>nomenclature of genes of Scifir</strong>. Genes are named with a stantard name that always is related to its effect. For example, the name of the gene that causes the eyes to be brown following this standard is <strong>"brown-eyes"</strong>.</p>
<h2>Names of molecules</h2>
<p>Here is explained the <strong>convention of molecule names of Scifir</strong>. This convention allows to use only the <strong>IUPAC nomenclature</strong> and, optionally, the <strong>common name</strong> of the molecule, if there's a common name defined for that molecule. If there isn't a common name, only the IUPAC nomenclature can be used.</p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>Depending of the type of data to store, the following file formats should be preferred to be used prioritarily to other file formats of the syme kind of data:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Complete genome, chromosomes, genes and dna strands:</strong> Use the <strong>.dna</strong> file format.</li>
	<li><strong>Animals, plants and fungus:</strong> Use the <strong>.life</strong> file format for the life form. For the history of the life form use <strong>.hlf</strong> inside the .life file, and the <strong>.dna</strong> file format for its genetic information inside that same .life file. If that life form has been created using the Bioeditor, the <strong>.lml</strong> file must be stored, it should't be losed.</li>
	<li><strong>3D representations:</strong> A 3d representation can be a representation of a life form or an object in real life, or a digital 3d graphic. 3d representations are stored using the <strong>L3D</strong> file format.</li>
	<li><strong>Molecules:</strong> Use a chemistry file format for molecules created in Scifir, currently not published.</li>
	<li><strong>Substances:</strong> Use a chemistry file format for substances created in Scifir, currently not published.</li>
	<li><strong>New words:</strong> Use the <strong>.cwd</strong> file format.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there's no other choice than to use another file format, just use it.</p>
<h2>Units</h2>
<p>The scalar units of measurement are written following the <strong>ISO of the units of measurement</strong>. According to that ISO, the magnitude of the units if written followed by an empty space and, then, the dimensions of the units of measurement, each of which can be preceded by a prefix. Also, the dimensions are multiplied with the character *, and divided with the character /.</p>
<h2>Mathematical objects</h2>
<h3>Vectors</h3>
<p>Vectors, in 3D, are written with their scalar unit followed by the angle theta and then the angle phi of the spherical coordinates. An example of such case is <strong>"3 N 20° 35°"</strong>.</p>

<h2>Coordinates</h2>
<h3>Geographical coordinates</h3>
<p>Here are explained the <strong>geographical coordinates of Scifir</strong>. This geographical coordinates of Scifir extend the geographical coordinates of the Earth to be used with any astronomical object in the universe.</p>
<h3>Astronomical coordinates</h3>
<p>The astronomical coordinates used vary related to the astronomical object where the coordinates to representes are located. Depending on that astronomical object the astronomical coordinates to use are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Planet:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> adapted to the shape of the planet are used, they are identical to the equatorial coordinates of the Earth but use the radius of the new planet.</li>
	<li><strong>Orbit of the planet:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> are used, but with a negative radius, because the point is outside the planet.</li>
	<li><strong>Moon:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> are used adapted to the shape of the moon.</li>
	<li><strong>Orbit of the moon:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> are used adapted to the moon, but with a negative radius, because the point is outside the moon.</li>
	<li><strong>Asteroid:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> are used adapted to the shape of the asteroid.</li>
	<li><strong>Orbit of the asteroid:</strong> The <strong>equatorial coordinates</strong> are used adapted to the asteroid, but with a negative radius, because the point is outside the asteroid.</li>
	<li><strong>Star system:</strong> The <strong>ecliptic coordinate system</strong> is used with the center being the center of the star of that star system.</li>
	<li><strong>Galaxy:</strong> The <strong>galactic coordinates</strong> are changed, instead of having the origin in the sun they have the origin in the galactic center.</li>
