## Layout

- Always place the **logo** of your website in the top-left corner of all webpages, inside the header bar, if there's a header. The logo must be a work done by a good graphic artist. Also, that logo must link to the webpage of url / of your domain name.
- Always place a **footer** with the public information of your website, include there also the logo of the website with a brief description of it. That brief description would not look so brief inside the footer, because the footer has a short space available. Inside the footer, place the links for contact and the sitemap. If the author of the website is public information, add that information inside the footer, too. Also, add that information inside the webpage about us.

## Technical aspects

- **robots.txt:** This file informs about how a crawler should index the website inside a web search engine.
- **Sitemap:** XML file that contains all the webpages of the website.
