The **Scifir document organization of inventions** is a short document, a descriptive summary, of how a scientific invention works, how it's builded its hardware, and how it's software is programmed. If the inventions works without software, that section then doesn't appears. The industrial design of the invention, that's, its shape, also appears.

## Scientific theory

The **scientific theory** section contains all the information conerning the scientific mechanisms of natural science from which the invention works. All the laws of science, behaviour of molecules, and biological properties related to the working mechanisms of the invention are explained here.

## Industrial design

The **industrial design** section contains drawings, with measures if needed, of the invention. All the external and the internal parts of the invention are represented in this section.

## Software

The **software** section contains all the description of the software, not the code, that makes the invention to work.

### Layers architecture

The **layers architecture** subsection describes all the different layers the software is composed of. If the software includes an embedded Linux distribution, busybox, a desktop environment, a GUI library, all those important components must be described here. The description of which layer does which function must also be added for every layer.

### UI

The **UI** subsection contains all the wireframes of the software, which clearly show how the digital interface is and how it's used.

### Functionalities

The **functionalities** subsection describes all the functions of the digital interface, everything it does.

### UX

The **UX** subsection describes all important UX features which makes easier to use the invention. Those functions can be related to save information, to configure the invention easier, or to use it with more simplicity.

## Hardware

The **hardware** section contains all the description of the hardware, by expressly evading to use any specific electronic component as possible, in order for the invention to be replicable with any hardware brand. As possible, all integrated circuits should be of a generic behaviour related to his category.

### Electronic circuit

The **electronic circuit** subsection contains the description of the electronic circuit, including the description of all integrated circuits, explaining their behaviour.

### UX of the hardware

The **UX of the hardware** subsection contains the description of all the facilities related not to the digital interface, but to the physical device.

## Bibliography

The **bibliography** section contains any important book, paper, article, biography, documentary, video, or any other important material that contains valuable information related to any important scientific topic related to the invention. The different materials listed here should be placed in order, with he most important material first.

## Summary in quick cards

The **summary in quick cards** consists of a summary of all this document, where usually only one card is needed for each subsection.
