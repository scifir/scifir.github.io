## Distribution formats

- **Physical format:** The videogame comes inside a blue-ray disc, a DVD, a CD, a cartridge, or any other storage device.
- **Digital format:** The videogame is purchased online and downloaded also online.

Not all videogames are available for the same platforms, some videogames have been created expressly to be executed only inside one specific platform.

Personally, I think all videogames should be available on all platforms that can execute it given its hardware requisites, that's, if a platform can execute a videogame because it meets the hardware requisites of it, then the videogame **must be** available for that platform. I think it would be good to have a **law of universal execution of videogames** that mandates that.

## Completing a videogame

- **Achievements:** All things needed to be completed by the player. Some achievements are really hard to get.
- **Post-game:** After completing the main story, all the different things that can be done in the videogame to finally complete it at a 100%.

## Additional content and related material

- **DLC:** Acronym of **Downloadable content**, it corresponds to additional content, as for example a secondary story, additional characters, or special objects, that can be purchased independently as the videogame.
- **Related material:** Articles related to the videogame, not being a videogame, and not necessarily being digital. Examples of them are the artbook, the soundtrack, and wallpapers.

The related material of a videogame can be anything of a wide number of categories, strictly it can be any kind of product, the most important ones are the following:

- **Artbook:** The most important related material. It contains explanations of all the art and ideas related to the story, the characters, the places, the objects, etc. When playing science-fiction videogames it's mandatory to read it in order to learn all there's to learn about the inventions that appear inside the videogame.
- **Soundtrack:** All the music of the videogame.
