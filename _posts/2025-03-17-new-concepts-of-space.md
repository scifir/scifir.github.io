Hello there! Here is an important article. Brief, but important. It defines a lot of concepts that are used inside Scifir for the projects related to the space, so learn them! They are very useful.

## New concepts

First, the outer space, which is used to define other concepts, is defined for clarity here:

- **Outer space:** The exterior space, only the "black" zone, being inside other planets doesn't corresponds the outer space.

The new concepts are the following:

- **Spacist:** Person that travels and lives through the outer space and planets.
- **Astroway:** Route defined inside the outer space to travel between astronomical objects, which can be planets, moons, stars, etc. The astroway is not necessarily marked in any way, in can be just drawn inside maps, because it's absurdly big to be constructed and marked inside the outer space.
- **Astrobuilding:** Building placed in the outer space.
- **Astroconstruction:** Construction placed in the outer space. It's different from an astrobuilding because an astrocontruction is not a building, but instead any other object, big or small, and even very big, placed in the outer space. For example, a sign that indicates the start of an astroway is an astroconstruction, but is not an astrobuilding.
- **Astrohouse:** Lighthouse placed in the outer space. It maintains registries of the spaceships that are travelling starting or passing through the zone the astrohouse monitors.

## Types of spaceships

The types of spaceships, based on the distance they can travel, are the following three:

- **Planetary spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other planets of the same solar system it's placed in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Stellar spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other stars of the same galaxy in a human feasible amount of time. Also called **interstellar spaceship**.
- **Galactic spaceship:** Spaceship that has enough speed to travel to other galaxies in a human feasible amount of time.

### Types of propulsors

The propulsors are named as the spaceship they allow to build:

- **Planetary propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other planets of the same solar system in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Stellar propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other stars of the same galaxy in a human feasible amount of time.
- **Galactic propulsor:** Propulsor that achieves enough speed to its ship to travel to other planets of the same solar system in a human feasible amount of time.

## Specialized spaceships

The specialized spaceships for some specific purpose are the following:

- **Exploration spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in exploring the space.
- **Home spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in exploring the space, and also in being used as a home when exploring another planet. Then, it's not needed to construct a home in the planet being explored.
- **Construction spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in constructing in the outer space.
- **Repair spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in repairing other spaceships in the outer space.
- **Colonizer spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in creating a colony in a new planet.
- **Cargo spaceship:** Spaceship specialized in transporting high amounts of some minerals or substances.

## Types of space maps

- **Universe map:** Map of all the universe, it indicates the galaxies. It's divided in different parts because all the galaxies doesn't fit in one single map. Instead, the map of all the universe is done dividing the universe in different very big parts and writing in a map all the galaxies of that part, and continuing then to the next part. Also, the parts that are at the top or at the bottom to the part drawn are also other parts to draw. Joining all those maps it's created the map of the universe.
- **Galaxy map:** Map of a galaxy. It can be divided in various submaps, not including also the maps of each solar system present inside the galaxy, and of each planet and moon of each of those solar systems.
- **Solar system map:** Map of a solar system. It must include the star and all the planets that orbit around it, with their moons, if they have. Other astronomical objects not as big as the planets and moons are optional to be drawn.
- **Planet map:** Map of a planet.
- **Moon map:** Map of a moon.
