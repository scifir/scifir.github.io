By using the bioeditor it's possible to create the DNA sequence of a pokemon. Besides that, to have the first pokemon egg it's needed to create the egg, too. This article is about how to create that egg, and also general steps about getting the DNA sequence of a pokemon, too. The DNA sequece is explained after the egg because it's a more complex topic to cover, and the approach of explaining first the easiest topic seems to work fine for this article.

## How to create the egg

To create the egg of a pokemon, the first that's needed is to understand that an egg develops organisms who's genetical information contains the genes that allow to born through eggs, like birds. In order to know those genes the first important information to have is that the development of an embryo inside an egg is very similar to the development of that embryo inside the utherus of the mother, as mammals. The difference is that the egg needs to have all the nutrients inside, in opposition as when it's inside the utherus, because in that last case the embryo gets the nutrients through the umbilical cord. Then, when building the egg manually, not inside an oviduct, there must be added all the nutrients the embryo will need not only for the first day of development inside the egg but for the total amount of gestation days.

Inside a life incubator, the nutrients and the number of gestation days should remain the same as with an egg, or at least not vary very much.

## Creating the DNA sequence of a pokemon

To create the DNA sequenece of a pokemon the first that's needed to do is to start with the DNA sequence of an animal already similar to it. For example, for **Kyogre** it's possible to start with the **Orcinus orca**. The second step is to check the embryonic development of the selected species. In that embryonic development there will be growth factors that act as signals for the development of the organism. By changing the concentration of those growth factors, or adding new ones, is possible to change the final morphology of the organism. After that, you can now delete all the cells, from the genome, related to tissues that won't be in the final organism, in order to have a more compact DNA, and also to avoid possible problemas with those extra genes that were important only for the starting species. In the example of Kyogre, the cells related only to the fin can change in Kyogre because it has two fins, while the Orcinus orca has just one.
