Hello! I'm [Ismael Correa Castro](https://iarfen.github.io), and in this article I'll explain the basics concepts that I've defined for the field that I've called **creational biology**, also called **homunculogy**. Creational biology is defined as the **branch of biology** that deals with the creation of life with artificial means. A life form created by any artificial mean is called an **homunculous**.

## Theory of recurrent insertion

The theory of recurrent insertion, created by [Ismael Correa Castro](https://iarfen.github.io) on 2007, says the following:

"Every lifeform that can be drawn has a DNA sequence in the real world that makes it to exist".

## The DNA Editor

## The incubation system

## Types of homunculous

- **New animals:** Any animal species new, like a dragon, a pokemon, etc.
- **Clones:** Any clone of a real life form should be considered an homunculous.
- **Imaginary friends:** Any imaginary friend created in real life, having been thinked or based on an object, usually a plushie.

### Robots aren't homunculous

**Robots aren't alive**, they just apparent it, an partially.

## Classification of homunculous

- **Biorobot:** An homunculous and, then, a biological organism, that has external appearance of a robot, but lives with organs.
- **Spirit:** An homunculous that has appearance of an spirit, besides if his body collides with the physical world or not.
- **Humanoid:** An homunculous with an appearance similar, but not identical, to the human species, like fairies, dwarfs, elves.

## Biological design

## Genome and mental characteristics

## Genome and genre

## Laws of homunculous

- An homunculous is **free** related to his creation.
- An homunculous has **free will**, it must obey the laws, the human rights and the homunculous rights.
- There's a **declaration of homunculous rights** equivalent to human rights.
- An homunculous can't be **strongly predestined**, he can only be predestined in small compromises.
