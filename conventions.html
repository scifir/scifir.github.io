<h1>Conventions of Scifir</h1>
<p>The <strong>Conventions of Scifir</strong> are used mandatorily inside Scifir projects, ad you can use them optionally in any project outside of Scifir you want. They help to have more order in the project, less disorder, less paperwork, and programs less error-prone.</p>
<h2>Nomenclature of genes</h2>
<p>The nomenclature of genes of Scifir, created by Ismael Correa, should be used always, we think there's no other convention for the names of genes that works properly. Other conventions for names of genes give an unespellable word, impossible to spell and to remember. The nomenclature of genes of Scfir, instead, gives common names easy to remember.</p>
<h2>Scifir summary of inventions</h2>
<p>The Scifir summary of inventions allows to quickly summarize an invention explaining all their parts in just some sheets or images (images of the sheet).</p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>The file formats that are always used in Scifir are the following, they are prioritized against other options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>.dna:</strong> To store genetic information inside a computer.</li>
	<li><strong>.l3d:</strong> To store 3D models, both of real life and imaginary.</li>
	<li><strong>.protein:</strong> To store aminoacid sequences of a protein.</li>
	<li><strong>.molecule:</strong> To store atomic structure of a molecule.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage of scientific data</h2>
<p>The scientific data is stored using the same file formats inside databases and also inside other xml or json files:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scalar units:</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Vector units:</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Coordinates:</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>DNA:</strong> Store it using the same contents of the .dna file.</li>
	<li><strong>3D models:</strong> To store 3D models, both of real life and imaginary.</li>
	<li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Store the aminoacid sequence.</li>
	<li><strong>Molecules:</strong> Store the contents of the .molecule file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nomenclature of scalar units, vector units and coordinates</h2>
<h2>Identifiers of location</h2>
<h2>Astronomical coordinates</h2>
<h2>Project texts stored in a security copies system</h2>
