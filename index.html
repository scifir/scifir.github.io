	<p>Scifir is organized in the following way, which can be imitated partially or completely in any other science organization:</p>
	<div id="home_organization_box">
	<ul id="home_organization_explanation">
		<li><strong>News:</strong> Any important news about Scifir, can be about any project, member, or anything that has happened.</li>
		<li><strong>Projects:</strong> The scientific projects we are developing. All projects inside Scifir have <strong>open participation</strong>, and any scientist can join or make comments. Each project has its own website, which can be the GitHub repository or a complete website.</li>
		<li><strong>Articles:</strong> Articles about science. They are publications of science concepts, theories, formulas, experiments and inventions, but they have a text format different than common papers, so they are called inside Scifir articles.</li>
		<li><strong>Guides:</strong> Learning material of science, usually summarized, which is better to read previous to the lecture of an entire book.</li>
