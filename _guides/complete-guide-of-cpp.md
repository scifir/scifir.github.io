## Standard library

## Important libraries

Important libraries of C++ are the following:

- **ICU:** It means International Characters for Unicode, it allows to manager strings that can display any Unicode character.
- **boost:** Very big library that includes a big amount of libraries inside, covering similar use cases than the standard library.

For testing there exist the following libraries:

- **CATCH:** It allows unit testing and benchmarking. Very simple to use.

To use XML files inside C++ programs there are the following libraries:

- **rapidxml:** Library that parses XML very fast.
- **libxml2:**
- **tinyxml:**
