A recopilation of different important programming rules are listed here. They are not programming rules invented at all inside Scifir, they have been created by developers without a system involved automatically when trying and learning how to program better, thinking in how to develop software as better as possible.

- **Very basic:** All the code is written in **english**, excepting the strings of translations.
- Use **man** to document the software, if it's a package.
- Specify the **authors** inside **man**, inside the **README** file, inside the **AUTHORS** file, and inside the **documentation** of the website. Inside the **website of the project**, if there's one, add them too in some webpage.
- **Unit tests** for all functions and classes, you should have a **100% of test coverage**.
